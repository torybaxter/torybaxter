# Hi, I'm Tory 

I’m a **Front-End Developer** based in Seattle, with roots in Chicago and Los Angeles. I spend my time building interactive websites that support artists, small businesses, and nonprofits — combining design, code, and creativity to create meaningful digital tools.

My background is in **branding strategy, design, cause marketing, and film production**, so I bring a unique perspective to building web experiences. I love mountains, giant trees, coffee, and my two cats.
